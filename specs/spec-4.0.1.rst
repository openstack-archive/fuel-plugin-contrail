Fuel Contrail plugin 4.0.1 specs
================================


Provide dedicated Contrail Analytics node
=========================================

Problem description
-------------------

Contrail plugin 3.0 implements deployment of Contrail analytics services
in co-location with Contrail config services on the nodes with role
'contrail-config'.
In highly scaled environments under load by thousands of network objects
and instances, a high amount of analytics data can be continiously generated,
causing the high resource usage by contrail-analytics services. That can
negatively impact the performance of contrail-config services running on
the name node.

Proposed solution
-----------------

Create a plugin-defined node role with name 'contrail-analytics' to provide the
possibility to deploy the components of contrail-analytics to a dedicated node or
set of nodes.
The services that should be moved to a dedicated role are Collector, Analytics
API, Query engine, Topology and Alarm generator.
Haproxy configuration should be updated to change the backend addresses to hosts
running analytics api [0].
This role is mandatory for the contrail-enabled environments, so there must be
at least one node with this role. To achieve high availability the environment
should contain multiple nodes with 'contrail-analytics' role, odd number is
recommended.
The 'contrail-analytics' role can be mixed with other contrail roles
('contrail-db','contrail-config','contrail-control') in small environments,
but not compatible with other OpenStack roles on the same node.
It should be possible to add or remove contrail-analytics nodes after environment
has been deployed.

UI impact
---------

There are no changes in plugin settings tab.

Performance impact
------------------

Using dedicated nodes for contrail analytics can enhance performance of contrail
config services.

Documentation Impact
--------------------

User guide should be updated with information on new node role.

Upgrade impact
--------------

Experimental scripts for contrail packages upgrade should be updated with
upgrade tasks for 'contrail-analytics' role.

Data model impact
-----------------

None

Other end user impact
---------------------

A new role with name 'contrail-analytics' will be available for assigning to
slaves in nodes tab of Fuel Web UI.

Security impact
---------------

None

Notifications impact
--------------------

None

Requirements
------------

Server requirements are described in [1].
There is no additional disk space requirements for this role, as analytics
services store the data in Cassandra database.


Enable memcache support for contrail keystone middleware
========================================================

Problem description
-------------------

In highly scaled environments under load by thousands of network objects
and instances validating the identity of every client on every request can cost a lot of
computing resources that can produces a big latency in work of Contrail and OpenStack services.
That can negatively impact the performance of whole environment.

Proposed solution
-----------------

Enable caching keystone tokens for Contrail purposes. Similar to
`OpenStack approach <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/keystonemiddleware/middlewarearchitecture.html#improving-response-time>`_
Contrail can cache authentication responses from the keystone in memcache. This feature will be enabled by
default and doesn't require any additional settings from Fuel UI. Kyestone middleware will use memcache
servers running local Contrail config nodes.

UI impact
---------

There are no changes in plugin settings tab.

Performance impact
------------------

Using caching keystone tokens for Contrail can reduce load of keystone service
respectively enhance performance of Contrail and OpenStack services

Add TOR/TSN functionality to Contrail Plugin
============================================

Problem description
-------------------

Contrail provides ability of extending a cluster to include bare metal servers and other virtual
instances connected to a top-of-rack (TOR) switch that supports the Open vSwitch Database Management
(OVSDB) Protocol. The bare metal servers and other virtual instances can belong to any of the
virtual networks configured in the Contrail cluster, facilitating communication with the virtual
instances running in the cluster. Contrail policy configurations can be used to control this
communication.
User need to have ability to configure ToR service node and ToR agents by plugin.

Proposed solution
-----------------

Provide new node role in fuel: ToR Services Node (TSN). This host will configure TSN services and
agent to comunicate with ToR switches. Users will provide all information in settings tab, and based
on this plugin will configure ToR agents - one per ToR switch provided by user.
TSN node role should be standalone and incompatible  with following roles: contrail-analytics,
contrail-control, contrail-config, contrail-db, controller, compute, ceph-osd, cinder

UI impact
---------

Additional node role for TSN, checkbox for TSN functionality in settings, textfield in settings
for providing TOR informations. TOR settings have to be provided in YAML format.

Performance impact

Make provisioning of default networks optional
==============================================

Problem description
-------------------

Some environemnts may require changes to default networks created during deployment for OSTF tests.
As an example, network allocated for floating IP addresses may need some exclusions in address
allocation for more-specific routes.
This affects the ability to deploy changes to OpenStack environments, with fails on default
network creation.

Proposed solution
-----------------

Make default networks provisioning optional, and allow manual networks creation.


UI impact
---------
Checkbox for default networks provisioning added. It should be enabled by default.

Performance impact
------------------

None

Documentation Impact

DPDK-based vRouter feature
==========================

Problem description
-------------------

DPDK (Data Plane Development Kit) allows access to the hardware directly from
applications, bypassing the Linux networking stack (binding interface will not be
seen by the kernel). This reduces latency and allows more packets to be processed.
Plugin need to support installing of Contrail vRouter in this mode.

Proposed solution
-----------------

Create a role called 'DPDK' to mark compute nodes which should be configured to
use DPDK-based vRouter. Hugepages setup must be handled by plug-in, since there's
no hugepages support in Fuel 8.0. For hugepages there should be 2 settings:
type and amount of pages to allocate. Type has 2 options: 2MB and 1GB.
Amount should be specified as a percentage from all available memory.
DPDK-based vRouter should use 'Private' interface, in the same way as kernel-based
vRouter does.

DPDK-based vRouter requires some patches to nova-compute, which are not available
in upstream code. Proposed solution is to override Nova packages on Compute nodes
with packages from Contrail distribution. This override should be optional.

DPDK-based vRouter requires VMs to be backed by hugepages. This feature is available
starting from QEMU 2.1, so QEMU and libvirt should be installed from
Contrail distibution. This override should be optional.

UI impact
---------

'DPDK' role should be present in list of roles.
There should be a checkbox that enables DPDK in environment.
Hugepages should have 2 settings: dropdown menu for type and a textfield for amount.
QEMU and Nova overrides should have checkboxes for toggling this overrides.

Performance impact
------------------

DPDK can be used to increase packet-rate performance on VMs, using DPDK-based
application. With non-DPDK applications performance should be approximately same
as with kernel-based vRouter.

Documentation Impact
--------------------

User guide should be updated with information about usage of this feature.

Network card on Computes which are selected to use DPDK, should support DPDK.
_`List of supported NICs <http://dpdk.org/doc/nics>`

Enable SRIOV for Contrail
=========================

Problem description
-------------------

The PCI-SIG Single Root I/O Virtualization and Sharing (SR-IOV) specification
defines a standardized mechanism to create natively shared devices providing dedicated
resources within the Ethernet controller (Physical Function) via Virtual Functions.
Contrail supports SR-IOV starting from version 3.0, so the Fuel Contrail plugin should
also support this feature.

Proposed solution
-----------------

To select the compute nodes with SR-IOV enabled, a plugin-defined role will be added.
The NICs on hosts carrying this role will be configured to use the maximum number of VFs
supported on the particular system. The network cards for SR-IOV are selected to satisfy
such conditions:
- NIC supports SR-IOV
- NIC is not a part of any bond, bridge and is not used with vRouter
- link state is up
The list of PCI IDs of SR-IOV NICs will be added to pci_passthrough_whitelist on compute nodes,
PciPassthroughFilter will be enabled on controllers.

UI impact
---------

SR-IOV compute role should be present in list of node roles.
Plugin settings should have a checkbox that enables SR-IOV globally.
A field with physnet name for SR-IOV should be added to plugin settings.

Performance impact
------------------

SR-IOV makes it possible to run a large number of VMs with high network load per compute host
without increasing the number of physical NICs, off-loading the hypervisor and significantly improving
both throughput and gaining deterministic network performance.

Documentation Impact
--------------------

User guide should be updated with information on how to enable SR-IOV

Upgrade impact
--------------

None

Data model impact
-----------------

None

Other end user impact

A new role with name 'SR-IOV' will be available for assigning to
computes in nodes tab of the Fuel Web UI.

Security impact

Notifications impact
--------------------

None

Requirements
------------

Compute nodes are expected to be equipped with network cards cappable of SR-IOV,
SR-IOV must be enabled in BIOS settings.

DPDK-based vRouter on virtual function (VF)
===========================================

Problem description
-------------------

DPDK (Data Plane Development Kit) allows access to the hardware directly from
applications by passing Linux networking stack (binding interface will not be
seen by the kernel). This reduces latency and allows more packets to be processed.
However, it has many `limitations <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/keystonemiddleware/middlewarearchitecture.html#improving-response-time>`_
and many features that Linux provides are not available with DPDK. Binding interface is not
seen by the kernel and accordingly - the user can't reuse it. For environment with complex network
schema or on servers with low amount of network interfaces it can be significant disadvantage.

Proposed solution
-----------------

Instead of whole interface use the Virtual Function as a target for DPDK-based
vRouter. This will allow to use same hardware adapter as used for DPDK-based vRouter for other purposes.

UI impact
---------
Checkbox in DPDK section of contrail settings. It will be disabled by default.
Also DPDK and SRIOV roles need to be assigned on node to enable this feature
(more details will be described in documentation).

Performance impact
------------------

No additional impact compared to the main DPDK feature.

Documentation Impact
--------------------

User guide should be updated with information about usage of this feature.

Enable HTTPS for public Contrail endpoints
==========================================

Problem description
-------------------

OpenStack and Contrail services receive requests from public networks that are untrusted area.
As the network path between the end-users and the services is untrusted, encryption is required to
ensure confidentiality. This can be achieved by implementing Secure Sockets Layer as recommended in
the OpenStack security guide.

Proposed solution
-----------------

Fuel can configure secure access for public-facing OpenStack services such as Nova API and Horizon
by configuring Haproxy to receive SSL connections as described in [2].
However, Contrail configuration API has no encryption enabled, but is exposed on public endpoint.
Contrail Web UI has SSL enabled, but uses self-signed certificate by default.
Fuel Contrail plugin should inherit SSL/TLS settings from Fuel UI configuration and configure
encrypted public endpoints for Contrail API and Contrail Web UI using the hostname and cerificate
shared with Horizon.

UI impact
---------

There are no changes in plugin settings tab.

Performance impact
------------------

The SSL-overhead is generally small. The major cost of HTTPS is the SSL handshaking so depending the
typical session length and the caching behavior of clients the overhead may be different. For very
short sessions you can see performance issue.
