Contrail HA DPDK
----------------


ID
##

contrail_ha_dpdk


Description
###########

Check Contrail deploy on HA environment


Complexity
##########

advanced


Steps
#####

    1. Create an environment with "Neutron with tunneling segmentation" as a network configuration and CEPH storage
    2. Enable and configure Contrail plugin
    3. Deploy cluster with some controller+mongo, compute+ceph-osd, compute+dpdk and contrail-specified nodes
    4. Run OSTF tests


Expected results
################

All steps should pass
