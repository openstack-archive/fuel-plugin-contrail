Deploy a cluster with Contrail Plugin and VMWare


Complexity
##########

advanced


Steps
#####

    1. Connect to a Fuel with preinstalled Contrail plugin.
    2. Create a new environment with following parameters:
       * Compute: vCenter
       * Networking: Neutron with tunneling segmentation
       * Storage: default
       * Additional services: default
    3. Run script that prepares vmware part for deployment (creates few Distributed
       Switches and spawns virtual machine on each ESXi node)
    4. Configure Contrail plugin settings:
       * Datastore name
       * Datacenter name
       * Uplink for DVS external
       * Uplink for DVS private
       * DVS external
       * DVS internal
       * DVS private
    5. Add nodes with following roles:
       * Controller
       * ComputeVMWare
       * Compute
       * Contrail-controller
       * Contrail-analytics + contrail-analytics-db
       * Contrail-vmware
    6. Configure interfaces on nodes.
    7. Configure network settings.
    8. Configure VMware vCenter settings on VMware tab.
    9. Deploy the cluster.
    10. Run OSTF tests.


Expected results
################

Cluster should be deployed and all OSTF test cases should be passed.
