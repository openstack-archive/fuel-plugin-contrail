Complexity
##########

advanced


Steps
#####

    1. Connect to a Fuel with preinstalled Contrail plugin.
    2. Create a new environment with following parameters:
       * Compute: QEMU
       * Networking: Neutron with tunneling segmentation
       * Storage: Ceph
       * Additional services: ceilometer
    3. Configure Contrail plugin settings:
       * enable and configure ToR agents
    4. Add nodes with following roles:
       * 3 Controller
       * 1 TSN
       * 2 Compute + Ceph
       * 1 contrail-controller
       * 1 contrail-analytics + contrail-analytics-db
    5. Configure interfaces on nodes.
    6. Configure network settings.
    7. Deploy the cluster.
    8. Run OSTF tests.
    9. Verify that TLS certificate should be  generated for TSN and TOR.
