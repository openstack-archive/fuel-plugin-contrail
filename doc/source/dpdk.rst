DPDK-based vRouter
==================

Description
-----------

The Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) is a set of data plane libraries and network
interface controller drivers for fast packet processing. The DPDK provides a programming
framework for Intel x86 processors and enables faster development of high-speed
data packet networking applications.

By default, contrail virtual router (vrouter) is running as a kernel module on Linux.

The vrouter module is able to fill a 10G link with TCP traffic from a virtual
machine (VM) on one server to a VM on another server without making any
assumptions about hardware capabilities in the server NICs. Also, in order to
support interoperability and use a standards-based approach, vrouter does not
use new protocols/encapsulations. However, in network function virtualization
(NFV) scenarios, other performance metrics such as packets-per-second (pps) and
latency are as important as TCP bandwidth. With a kernel module, the pps number
is limited by various factors such as the number of VM exits, memory copies and
the overhead of processing interrupts.

In order to optimize performance for NFV use cases, vrouter can be integrated with the Intel DPDK (Data Plane Development Kit). To integrate with DPDK, the vrouter can now run in a user process instead of a kernel module.

This process links with the DPDK libraries and communicates with the vrouter host agent, which runs as a separate process. The application inside the guest VM can be written to use the DPDK API or it can use the traditional socket API. However, for NFV applications such as vMX, which require high performance, it would be preferable to use the DPDK API inside the VM.

Prerequisites
-------------

- Installed `Fuel 7.0 <https://docs.mirantis.com/openstack/fuel/fuel-7.0/user-guide.html>`_
- Installed contrail plugin :doc:`/install_guide`
- Environment must be created with "KVM" for compute virtualization and "Neutron with tunneling segmentation" for networking
- Network card must support DPDK. List of compatible adapters can be found on `DPDK website <http://dpdk.org/doc/guides/nics/index.html>`_

Restrictions
------------

- Only compute hosts can be configured with DPDK role. "DPDK role" is just a mark that enables DPDK feature on certain compute. If you try to use it with other roles it wouldn't have any effect.

- Contrail DPDK feature doesn't work with qemu virtualization as far as with nested KVM. This means that for current release DPDK-based vRouter works only on baremetal computes.

- Contrail DPDK vrouter permanently uses 1GB of hugepages, therefore, it is necessary to allocate enough amount of hugepages to run DPDK vrouter and VM's(with DPDK) respectively.

Configuration
-------------

To enable DPDK you should proceed with following steps:

#. Enable contrail plugin in Fuel UI settings

   .. image:: images/enable_contrail_plugin.png


#. Enable DPDK on Fuel UI

   .. image:: images/enable_contrail_dpdk.png

#. Choose the size and amount of huge pages to allocate. They will be used for
   both vRouter process and VMs backing. 2MB sized huge pages can be added on-fly,
   1GB sized require a reboot. Also, it is necessary to leave some amount of memory
   for the operating system itself.


#. Add DPDK role on computes where you want to have DPDK-based vRouter.
   **Computes that are not marked with DPDK role will use kernel-based vRouter.**

#. Deploy environment

   .. warning::
      Computes with DPDK-based vRouter require flavor with HugePages enabled.
      **Instances with usual flavours can't be launched on DPDK-enabled hosts.**

   If DPDK is enabled in plugin settings Fuel will create one flavor that will have hugepages support, named "m1.small.hpgs". One can create custom flavor with following steps on controller node::

    # . openrc
    # nova flavor-create m2.small.hpgs auto 2000 20 2
    # nova flavor-key m2.small.hpgs set hw:mem_page_size=large
    # nova flavor-key m2.small.hpgs set aggregate_instance_extra_specs:hpgs=true

Verification
------------

After deploy finishes, you can verify your installation. First, proceed with basic checks.

#. Check that Contrail services and DPDK vrouter are running on compute node::

    root@node-37:~# contrail-status
    == Contrail vRouter ==
    supervisor-vrouter:           active
    contrail-vrouter-agent        active
    contrail-vrouter-dpdk         active
    contrail-vrouter-nodemgr      active

#. Check if DPDK vrouter catch interface::

    root@node-37:~# /opt/contrail/bin/dpdk_nic_bind.py -s

DPDK related options
--------------------

In this chapter described DPDK related options that you can change from Fuel UI:

- *"Enable DPDK feature for this environment."* - this option enable DPDK globally, remember that you anyway must use "DPDK" role to mark compute where you want to have DPDK
- *"Hugepage size"* - Choose the size of huge pages that will be used for a dpdk feature. Check if 1GB pages are supported on the target compute node. # grep pdpe1gb /proc/cpuinfo | uniq
- *"Hugepages amount (%)"* - set amount of memory allocated on each compute node for huge pages. It will use % of all memory available on compute. Remember that DPDK vrouter permanently use 1GB of huge pages and other applications running on compute node may not support huge pages, so this parameter should be used carefully.
- *"CPU pinning"* - this hexadecimal value describes how many and which exact processors will be used by dpdk-vrouter. CPU pinning is implemented using `taskset util <http://www.linuxcommand.org/man_pages/taskset1.html>`_
- *"Patch Nova"* - current release (7.0) of MOS nova doesn't have support for DPDK-based vRouter. In future, necessary patches will be included in MOS maintenance updates.
- *"Install Qemu and Libvirt from Contrail"* - DPDK-based vRouter needs huge pages memory-backing for guests. MOS 7.0 ships with qemu and libvirt that don't support it. This is needed only for DPDK feature and will be implemented only on nodes where we have "DPDK" role.
