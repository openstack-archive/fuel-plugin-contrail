Installation Guide
==================

Prerequisites
-------------

This guide assumes that you have installed `Fuel <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/fuel-docs/userdocs/fuel-user-guide.html>`_
and all the nodes of your future environment are discovered and functional.

Install Contrail Plugin
-----------------------

To install the Contrail plugin:

#.  Download the Contrail plugin from the
    `Fuel Plugins Catalog <https://software.mirantis.com/download-mirantis-openstack-fuel-plug-ins/>`_.

#.  Copy the rpm package downloaded at the previous step to the Fuel Master node and install the plugin
    ::

        scp contrail-4.0-4.0.1-1.noarch.rpm  <Fuel Master node ip>:/tmp/

#.  Log into the Fuel Master node and install the plugin
    ::

        ssh <the Fuel Master node ip>
        fuel plugins --install contrail-4.0-4.0.1-1.noarch.rpm

    You should get the following output
    ::

        Plugin <plugin-name-version>.rpm was successfully installed

#.  Copy the Juniper Contrail installation package to the Fuel Master node and run the installation
    script to unpack the vendor package and populate the plugin repository:

    .. note::

       You can obtain the Juniper Contrail installation package from Juniper by subscription.
       More information can be found on the
       `official Juniper Contrail web-site <http://www.juniper.net/us/en/products-services/sdn/contrail/contrail-networking/>`__.

    ::

        scp contrail-install-packages_3.0.2.1-4~liberty_all.deb \
        <Fuel Master node ip>:/var/www/nailgun/plugins/contrail-4.0/
        ssh <Fuel Master node ip> /var/www/nailgun/plugins/contrail-4.0/install.sh

Configure Contrail Plugin
-------------------------

To configure the Contrail plugin, follow the steps below:

#.  `Create environment <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/fuel-docs/userdocs/fuel-user-guide.html>`_
    in Fuel web UI.

    .. image:: images/name_and_release.png

#.  Select KVM or QEMU hypervisor type for your environment

    .. image:: images/compute.png

.. raw:: latex

    \pagebreak

3.  Please select Contrail SDN networking setup.

    .. image:: images/networking_setup.png


#.  If you plan to use Heat orchestration with autoscaling, install Ceilometer.

    .. image:: images/additional_services.png


#.  Enable the plugin and fill configuration fields with correct values:

    *   AS number for BGP Gateway nodes communication defaults to 64512

    *   IP addresses of gateway nodes provided as a comma-separated list - peer addresses
        for BGP interaction with border routers.

.. raw:: latex

    \pagebreak

6.  Add nodes and assign them the following roles:

    *   At least 1 Controller

    *   At least 1 Compute

    *   At least 1 node with Contrail-Control, Contrail-Config, Contrail-Analytics and Contrail-DB roles selected

        .. note::

           Three or the greater odd number of nodes recommended for HA.

    *   If you plan to use Heat with autoscaling, in addition to Ceilometer you need to add node with MongoDB role

    You do not need to have these three roles on the same node.
    You can place them on different nodes if needed. For example, place Database and Analytics
    on dedicated nodes to improve performance.

    .. image:: images/contrail-roles.png


    The figure below shows sample node configuration.

    .. image:: images/node-roles.png


#.  The recommended size of partition for the Contrail database is 256 GB or more.

#.  Configure the network settings. See details at
    `Fuel User Guide <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/fuel-docs/userdocs/fuel-user-guide.html>`_.

    Open :guilabel:`Nodes` tab, select all the nodes and press :guilabel:`Configure interfaces` button

    .. image:: images/conf-interfaces.png


    Set Private network to the separate network interface.

    .. warning::

       Do not use this physical interface for any other network.

    Contrail vRouter will use this interface.
    Set the bigger MTU for Private interfaces, for example 9000, if switching hardware supports
    Jumbo Frames.
    This will enhance contrail network performance by avoiding packet fragmentation within
    Private network.

    .. image:: images/public-net.png

    .. warning::

        First usable addresses from the Private network will be used as VIP for Contrail controllers.
        For example, if your Private network CIDR is ``192.168.200.0/24``, then Contrail VIP will be ``192.168.200.1``.
        If you want to use other IP as VIP, you need to specify a range for this network.

.. raw:: latex

    \pagebreak

9.  Example of network configuration

    Use hardware servers with two network interfaces as OpenStack nodes.
    The interfaces configuration is as follows:

    *   Management and Storage networks are on the same interface with ``Admin`` network using tagged VLANs

    *   The second interface is dedicated to Public network as untagged

    *   The forth interface is dedicated to Contrail operations as untagged (Private network)

    .. image:: images/conf-interfaces2.png

    .. warning::
       *  Be sure to launch
          `network verification check <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/fuel-docs/userdocs/fuel-user-guide.html>`_
          before starting deployment. Incorrect network configuration will result in
          non-functioning environment.

       * Some environemnts may require changes to default networks created during deployment
         for OSTF tests. For example, the network allocated for floating IP addresses may need
         some exclusions in address allocation for more specific routes. This affects the
         ability to deploy changes to OpenStack environments with fails on default network
         creation. For this reason Contrail plugin settings have an option that disables
         creation of default ostf networks. By default, this option is enabled.

         .. image:: images/provision_ostf_network.png



#.  Press :guilabel:`Deploy changes` to `deploy the environment (page 25)
    <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/fuel-docs/userdocs/fuel-user-guide.html>`_.

    After installation is finished, you can access
    `Contrail web UI <http://www.juniper.net/techpubs/en_US/contrail2.0/topics/task/configuration/monitor-dashboard-vnc.html>`_
    using the same IP address as OpenStack Dashboard and port 8143 through HTTPS protocol.
    For example, if you configured public network as described on the screenshot above, then you can
    access Contrail web UI through ``https://<Public-VIP>:8143``.
